## Why Is It Important?

Products in our everyday lives we often use only once. After these items are thrown away, they contribute to the growing waste problem, and many of them aren't able to break down into simpler components in a reasonable amount of time. To fight this issue, recycling can put old material into use again.

### Plastics
 - They rarely break down organically because they aren't biodegradable
 - It can take up to 1000 years for plastic to break down naturally!
 - Instead, if they end up in the ocean, they can break down into microplastics which make their way up the food chain and into our meals.
 - A better alternative is reusing the material through recycling

### Paper
 - Paper _can_ be recycled, so recycling it saves space in landfills for things which can't be
 - Recycling it saves energy and natural resources, including trees
 - One ton of recycled paper can save 17 trees and 7000 gallons of water, and 4000 kilowatts of energy

### Cardboard
 - Just like paper, recycling cardboard saves space in landfills
 - One ton of recycled cardboard can save 17 trees, 7000 gallons of water, and 1500 pounds of carbon dioxide from emitting into the environment
